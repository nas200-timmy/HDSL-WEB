/// Finds the bash a Windows-hosted agent wants for its own tools.
///
/// Agents ported from POSIX run their shell tools through a bash even on Windows
/// (kimi-code says so in its own error message, and honours
/// `KIMI_SHELL_PATH`). The panel can find Git for Windows for them: it is the
/// one bash a Windows machine is likely to have, it behaves like the bash the
/// agent was written against, and — unlike the `bash.exe` Windows itself puts on
/// `PATH` — it is not the WSL launcher.
///
/// That last point is the whole reason this class exists rather than a call to
/// [Executables#resolve]: `C:\Windows\System32\bash.exe` and the Windows Store's
/// `WindowsApps\bash.exe` are WSL shims. They exist on machines with no Git Bash
/// at all, they start a Linux distribution instead of a shell in the workspace,
/// and handing one to an agent is worse than saying "no bash found".
