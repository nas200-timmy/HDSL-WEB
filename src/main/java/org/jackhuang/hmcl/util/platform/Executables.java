/// Resolves program names to files that can actually be started on this system.
///
/// On POSIX a program is a file with the execute bit, and a name without a slash is
/// looked up on `PATH` — so the name a person types is the name to start, and
/// `ProcessBuilder` agrees. Windows is different in two ways that a launcher which only
/// ever ran on Linux never had to know:
///
/// 1. what is executable is decided by **extension**, so `npm` is really `npm.cmd` and
///    `node` is really `node.exe` — the name without its extension is not a file at all;
/// 2. `ProcessBuilder` passes the program to `CreateProcess` with `lpApplicationName`
///    unset, which resolves `node` to `node.exe` on its own but has nothing to say about
///    `.cmd`, so a bare `npm` fails with "the system cannot find the file specified".
///
/// What it does **not** mean is that `.cmd` needs a shell. `CreateProcess` runs a batch
/// file through `cmd.exe` itself when the command line names one, so handing it
/// `npm.cmd` runs the shim with the arguments exactly as given — no re-quoting, which is
/// the whole reason this class resolves the extension instead of wrapping in `cmd /c`.
/// (Measured on Windows 10 with JDK 21: bare `npm` → error 2, `npm.cmd` → runs;
/// an extensionless `npm` → error 193, "not a valid Win32 application".)
///
/// The extensions themselves come from `PATHEXT`, the variable whose whole purpose is
/// this list; the table below is only the fallback for a process that has none.
///
/// The two naming rules — **by extension** on Windows, **by execute bit** on POSIX — are
/// carried by [NameRules] rather than read from [OperatingSystem] at every call, so both
/// shapes can be exercised on any machine. [CURRENT] is the one the running system uses.
