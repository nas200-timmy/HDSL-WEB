/// Whether outbound HTTPS has to prove who it is talking to, and what to say when
/// it cannot.
///
/// Two facts make this a policy rather than a setting:
///
/// - A TLS-inspecting proxy — an antivirus, a corporate gateway, a GitHub
///   accelerator such as FastGithub — puts **its own** root in the Windows store,
///   while Java only reads its bundled `cacerts`. The browser opens the page, the
///   panel reports `PKIX path building failed`, and the visible symptom is a brand
///   version list that is simply empty. Nothing said why.
/// - Widening trust is a decision with a cost, so the panel does not take it on
///   its own. It **asks**: the failure is recorded and shown with the reason, and
///   only an explicit acknowledgement opens a window (time-limited, revocable)
///   during which an unverifiable certificate is accepted.
///
/// Even inside that window verification is not simply thrown away: the chain is
/// first checked against the machine's own roots (the proxy's root usually lives
/// there), and only a chain that fails *that* is accepted — logged with the
/// certificate it belonged to, so the audit trail names what was trusted.
///
/// The window is applied through `SSLContext.setDefault`, which every client this
/// panel builds afterwards picks up. Clients cached across the change would keep
/// the old context, so the ones on the GitHub path build per call.
