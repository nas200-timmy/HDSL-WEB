/// The capability classes an **agent** token may hold, and the two rules that
/// keep it from doing something no agent should be able to do.
///
/// A token minted through `POST /api/developer/agent-auth` — the agent signs
/// for it with the agent password — is a bearer credential an AI agent carries
/// on its own; the panel never sees a browser session behind it. The design
/// keeps the blast radius small in the only place the agent cannot rewrite —
/// **here, in the root process**:
///
/// 1. **Deny by default.** A request that matches no class below is refused,
///    so a route added later is closed to agents until someone says otherwise.
/// 2. **Self-fatal operations are refused.** Stopping the instance whose
///    process is running the call, or opening its terminal (which stops the web
///    runtime first), would kill the caller mid-request: the tool call could
///    never return and the transcript would end in silence. The panel answers
///    `409 self_operation_refused` instead, and the agent is expected to pick
///    another route.
///
/// Credential-leaking reads are refused outright: `GET /api/instances/{id}/open`
/// answers a URL carrying the instance's access token, `/api/exports/*` serves
/// build artifacts that may embed session content, and a brand instance's
/// `admin-password` is a generated credential — the first-run window hands it
/// out without any elevation, so only this layer can close it. None of them
/// belongs in a model's context.
///
/// The scope model also stops at the API boundary: `/i/*` (the reverse proxy)
/// and `/ws/*` (the event streams) are browser channels and are never reachable
/// with a grant, whatever class it names. An agent that needs an instance's
/// state asks the API for it; the panel then records who asked.
