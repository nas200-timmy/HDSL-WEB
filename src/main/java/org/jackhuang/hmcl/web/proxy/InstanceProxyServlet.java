/// The reverse proxy behind `/i/*`: one dsh web instance per mount, reached
/// through the loopback port its readiness line reported.
///
/// The translation follows the reference implementation in the dsh
/// repository (`apps/web/tests/prefix-proxy.ts`), ported to Jetty:
///
/// - `/i/<id>` without a trailing slash is a 301 to `/i/<id>/` (token exchange
///   needs the directory form), query string preserved;
/// - `/i/<id>/<rest>` forwards to `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/<rest>` where the
///   port comes from the readiness line, never from the manifest — a patch
///   layer may have moved the server;
/// - hop-by-hop headers are stripped in both directions; **the Host header
///   passes through untouched**, because dsh's browser-trust fence compares
///   Origin to Host and refuses rewritten requests;
/// - the browser's `Accept-Encoding` is **narrowed** to the encodings the body
///   rewriting can undo ([decodableAcceptEncoding]) — passing it through offered
///   the instance brotli, and a body this servlet cannot decode is a body it
///   cannot rewrite;
/// - `Set-Cookie: ...; Path=/` becomes `Path=/i/<id>/` so the cookies of two
///   instances (which share their names, decided by host alone) stop
///   overwriting each other;
/// - a redirect naming the instance's own address is rewritten onto the mount
///   — the token exchange answers with `303 Location: /`, and the browser that
///   follows it would leave the mount for the panel's own page;
/// - the page itself is rewritten on the way past: its `<base>` and its
///   `/plugins/` registrations are given the mount, and a small shim keeps the
///   requests it builds at runtime inside it (see [#rewritePage]);
/// - a third-party brand client (Kimi Code, OpenCode) gets its own script and
///   stylesheet rewritten as they pass: every root-absolute reference they build
///   at runtime — a lazily imported chunk, an icon, a font — is given the mount
///   it is served under ([#patchBrandScript], [#patchBrandStylesheet]);
/// - a client that routes by `location.pathname` gets one thing more from that
///   same rewrite: the address it reads is made mount-blind, so the address bar
///   can keep the mount and still match the client's routes (see [ROUTER_JS]);
/// - bodies stream in both directions (a `Flow.Publisher` over the servlet
///   input on the way up, `BodyHandlers.ofInputStream` on the way down), so
///   SSE — `/plugins/events` — works without special treatment;
/// - when the client goes away the upstream request is cancelled — the attempt
///   that is really in flight, first or retry (see [Upstream]).
///
/// WebSocket upgrades under `/i/*` are not handled here; Jetty routes them to
/// the [org.jackhuang.hmcl.web.proxy.InstanceProxyWebSocket] endpoint before
/// the servlet ever sees them.
///
/// That reference is a fixture for the dsh repository's own test client, and that
/// client is prefix-aware: it takes the mount as its base, follows the token
/// exchange itself (`redirect: 'manual'`, with a `Location` of `./` meaning "in
/// place"), and resolves every path against that base. The real web client is
/// not — it is built to own the origin — so four things here have no
/// counterpart upstream and are this launcher's own: the `Location` rewrite, the
/// page rewrite, the shim that keeps the requests the page builds at runtime
/// inside the mount, and the router patch that teaches a path-routed client the
/// mount it is served under (see [#rewritePage]). A reader comparing the two should not
/// read their absence upstream as an oversight here.
