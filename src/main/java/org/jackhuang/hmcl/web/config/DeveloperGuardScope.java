/// scope that covers what they are worried about:
///
/// - [OFF] — the panel session is the only door (the default, and the
///   behaviour of every release before the guard existed);
/// - [PROXY] — the instance web pages (`/i/<id>/*`, HTTP and WebSocket) also
///   need the developer password;
/// - [INSTANCE] — and so do the **state-changing** instance APIs (start, stop,
///   delete, installs, settings). Reads stay open so the list is still usable;
/// - [ALL] — every `/api/*` request except [#alwaysAllowed(String)], which is
///   the minimum a browser needs to log in and to reach the developer page.
///
/// The scope only decides which *new* requests are gated. An already-open page,
/// terminal or agent is untouched: that is the emergency stop's job, not the
/// guard's.
