/// Each instance is stored as `zcode/instances/<id>/instance.json` under the
/// server data directory — the same manifest style as
/// [org.jackhuang.hmcl.dsh.DshInstanceManager], in a directory tree of its own
/// so the experimental category never touches dsh state. The manager itself is
/// bound to the instances root at construction time because the root comes
/// from the server config rather than from the launcher's home directory.
///
/// An instance directory also holds everything the process owns at runtime:
/// `data/` (passed to ZCode as `ZCODE_DATA_BASE_DIR`, so each instance's
/// config, sessions and credentials are private) and `logs/zcode.log` (the
/// process's merged stdout and stderr). The default workspace of a new
/// instance lives next to the instances instead, under
/// `zcode/workspaces/<id>-<name slug>` — a project directory the operator can
/// see, keep and reuse, rather than state hidden inside the instance. The
/// `<instance>/workspace/` directory is only still read as the fallback for
/// manifests written before that move.
///
/// **Experimental.** Credential injection writes the personal provider config
/// ZCode reads from `<ZCODE_DATA_BASE_DIR>/.zcode/v2/provider_config.json`.
/// That file's shape is reverse-engineered from the ZCode v3.14.3 sources
/// (`packages/provider-node/src/provider-config-file-codec.ts` and
/// `packages/provider/src/config/rule-data-schema.ts`) and is **not a
/// documented, stable contract** — a future ZCode can rename or restructure it,
/// in which case the injection silently stops doing anything. Best effort,
