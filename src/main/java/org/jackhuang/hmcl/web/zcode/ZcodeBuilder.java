/// There is no official ZCode CLI distribution to download (the desktop apps
/// are the only release artifacts), so the category builds its own: this class
/// downloads the source tarball for a tag or branch, applies [ZcodePatch] so the
/// web client works behind the panel's `/i/<id>/` proxy, runs `pnpm install` and
/// `pnpm build:zcode`, verifies the `sha256` the build recorded, and installs
/// the result as `releases/<version>/` with `current` pointing at it.
///
/// It is a long, heavy job — a full monorepo install plus three builds, minutes
/// to tens of minutes and gigabytes of scratch space — so it runs on its own
/// thread with one build at a time, reports through [Status], and writes every
/// line of the child processes' output to `build/build.log` (the interface tails
/// it). The scratch tree is removed when the build ends, unless
/// `keepSources` says otherwise.
///
/// Everything is in-memory apart from the releases and the log: a panel restart
/// mid-build loses the build, which is accepted for an experimental category.
