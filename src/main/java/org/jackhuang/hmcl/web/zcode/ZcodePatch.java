/// The source edits the experimental ZCode category applies before building a
/// distribution.
///
/// ZCode's web client writes its root path into everything it emits — `/assets`
/// in the built HTML, `/api/server-info`, `wss://host/ws`, the OAuth token URL —
/// so an instance served by the panel's `/i/<id>/` proxy would ask the panel's
/// own root for its bundle and its API. Four small edits fix that:
///
/// - `vite.config.ts` gets `base: "./"`, so the HTML refers to its bundle
///   relatively and the proxy's injected `<base href="/i/<id>/">` resolves it;
/// - `main.tsx` gets a `hdslBasePath()` helper that reads the `/i/<id>/` prefix
///   off the browser's own path, and the WebSocket origin plus the
///   `/api/server-info` fetch go through it;
/// - the Z.ai OAuth config's `tokenUrl` gets the same prefix.
///
/// These are plain find/replace edits with a **unique-anchor requirement**, not
/// a `patch(1)` file: when upstream moves one of the anchors the build fails
/// with a message naming the file, instead of producing a distribution that
/// silently serves the wrong URLs. Keeping the patch honest is the whole point —
/// see `docs/zcode-experimental.md`.
