/// The POSIX pseudo terminal: `openpty` plus `posix_spawn`, glued with JNA.
///
/// Two decisions are load-bearing:
///
/// - **No `fork()`.** Forks in a JVM that has threads are unsafe; `posix_spawn`
///   is the portable, safe way to start a child. The child gets its own
///   process group (`POSIX_SPAWN_SETPGROUP` with pgroup 0), which is what
///   [#terminate] kills.
/// - **No JNA callbacks.** Everything is a blocking call made from a Java
///   thread (`poll` + `read`), so the native side never calls back into the
///   JVM and there is no callback-thread bookkeeping to get wrong.
///
/// When the child exits, the pump drains until the device reports EOF and then
/// reports that end itself; the master is closed right after, which ends the
/// session for every call that has not started yet. That is the property the
/// web terminal relies on: the moment the agent is gone, the screen can no
/// longer change. A call that is already inside the kernel when the close
/// happens is the one exception, and it is deliberate — see [MasterFd]: it
/// finishes on the descriptor it started with and hands over what it read,
/// which is exactly the tail the drain is trying to keep.
///
/// The master's *descriptor* has a lifetime rule of its own, in [MasterFd]: no
/// caller ever uses the descriptor's number directly, because the kernel
/// recycles numbers and this JVM runs several terminals at once.
