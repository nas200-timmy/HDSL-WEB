/// dsh's terminal surface, which is a plugin on a profile of its own.
///
/// There is no `dsh-tui` subcommand and no TUI from the harness itself — [DshSurface]
/// enumerates WEB, HEADLESS, ACP and SDK. The terminal is installed like any other
/// plugin and started by booting **its own profile** (`dsh --profile tui`, which upstream
/// also accepts as the bare `dsh tui`: a bare word is expanded into `--profile <word>`).
/// A terminal profile is not one of the harness's templates, so it exists only once a
/// plugin has been installed into it — which is exactly what the panel's install route
/// does, and why the profile comes from the catalogue rather than from the instance.
///
/// **The instance's web profile is never used here.** A terminal interface and
/// `dsh-web-app` are both *app* plugins: each parses the same argv with its own grammar
/// and upstream arbitrates nothing between them, so the pair stops the instance from
/// starting at all (the community's report is `error: unknown option '--no-open'`). This
/// class therefore asks [DshTuiPlugins] which profile the installed plugin belongs to,
/// builds the launch plan for that profile, and refuses a plan that would boot the web
/// app — a user's own `--profile web` in the instance's arguments included.
///
/// Two command shapes come out of that:
///
/// - a plugin that ships its own executable is started through it (`node
///   <profile>/node_modules/<package>/<its own bin>`), the way [KimiTui] starts an agent:
///   a package manager's `.bin` entry is a shell shim and starting through it would make
///   `/bin/sh` rather than the terminal the root process;
/// - a pure bundle has no entry of its own, so its profile is booted — and so is a
///   bin-shipping plugin whose file is not there, because that path always works.
