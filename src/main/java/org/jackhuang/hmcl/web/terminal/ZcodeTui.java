/// ZCode's interactive TUI: `node <release>/bin/zcode.mjs`, nothing else.
///
/// The distribution starts its TUI when no `--web` is passed; the web mode's
/// flags (`--web --no-open --host --port --no-token`) must not leak in here,
/// or the terminal would start a second web server inside a PTY.
///
/// The TUI must land on exactly the state the web mode writes, and the
/// distribution splits that state over two roots:
///
/// - `ZCODE_DATA_BASE_DIR` holds the credentials and the provider config
///   (`<base>/.zcode/v2/credentials.json`, `…/provider_config.json` — the file
///   [org.jackhuang.hmcl.web.zcode.ZcodeInstanceManager] writes), so it points
///   at the instance's `data/` directory, exactly as in the web launch;
/// - the session database follows `homedir()` (`<home>/.zcode/cli/db/db.sqlite`,
///   see `apps/zcode-cli/packages/adapters/src/storage/session-store/paths.ts`),
///   so `HOME` is deliberately **not** overridden: the web process inherits the
///   panel's `HOME`, and a TUI pointed at another one would list a different
///   set of sessions — the "configured it in the browser, gone in the terminal"
///   failure the instance home is supposed to prevent.
///
/// `--workspace` is deliberately not passed: the working directory already is
/// the instance workspace, and the runner only understands that flag in web
/// mode (`scripts/zcode-distribution/runner.mjs`).
