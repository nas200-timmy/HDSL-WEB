/// The Windows pseudo terminal: `CreatePseudoConsole` plus `CreateProcessW`,
/// glued with JNA.
///
/// Three decisions are load-bearing:
///
/// - **ConPTY, never a console window.** The pseudo console is part of Windows
///   since 10 1809 and needs no binary beside the jar. That is what makes the
///   terminal work in a session with no desktop — a service has nowhere to show
///   a console — and what lets the browser see the same bytes a local console
///   would have painted.
/// - **argv-only.** `lpApplicationName` is the program on its own and the
///   command line is built here; nothing goes through `cmd.exe`. That is also
///   why a `.cmd`/`.bat`/`.ps1`/`.com` program is refused: `CreateProcess`
///   silently hands those to `cmd.exe`, which would put a shell back in the
///   chain this class exists to keep out.
/// - **No JNA callbacks.** Everything is a blocking call made from a Java
///   thread (`ReadFile`, `WaitForSingleObject`), so the native side never calls
///   back into the JVM.
///
/// One detail is easy to miss and invisible when wrong: the child is started
/// with `STARTF_USESTDHANDLES` and all three handles NULL. Without that,
/// `CreateProcess` copies the *panel's* standard handles into the child, so an
/// agent's output goes into the panel's own log file while the console stays
/// empty (measured on Windows 10 19045). With it, the console subsystem gives
/// the child the pseudo console's own handles, which is what a terminal is.
///
/// The contract is [Pty]'s, not Windows': when the child exits, [output]
/// reaches EOF and [#waitFor] answers, and there is no prompt after it because
/// nothing else was ever started. The one place the two platforms differ is
/// [terminate]: Windows has no polite signal that reaches a process attached to
/// a pseudo console (`GenerateConsoleCtrlEvent` does not), so the terminal gets
/// a grace period to leave on its own and is then killed with its job object.
/// That is "end the session", not "SIGTERM", and it is documented as such.
///
/// Only 64-bit JVMs are promised. Handles are [Pointer]s throughout, so a
/// 32-bit runtime would not corrupt itself — it is just untested.
