/// A pseudo terminal running exactly the command it was given.
///
/// There is no shell in the chain: the command's first element is the program
/// and the rest are its arguments, handed to `posix_spawn` as an argv array on
/// POSIX and to `CreateProcessW` as argv-only on Windows. The child gets its own
/// process group (POSIX) or job object (Windows), so [#terminate] can sweep the
/// whole tree the agent may have spawned.
///
/// The three pieces of the contract that matter to the web terminal:
///
/// - **The child is the session.** When it exits, [output] reaches EOF and
///   [#waitFor] answers; there is no prompt after it, because nothing else was
///   ever started.
/// - **Input stops first.** Once the child is gone, writes are refused; the
///   terminal can never be handed to something else.
/// - **Resizing is `TIOCSWINSZ` on POSIX and `ResizePseudoConsole` on Windows**;
///   either way the child learns the new size.
