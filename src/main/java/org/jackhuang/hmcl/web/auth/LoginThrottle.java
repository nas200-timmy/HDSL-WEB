/// Refuses to keep answering guesses from one address.
///
/// The sign-in gate is the only way into the panel, and a password is the only thing in front of it —
/// so what matters most about that gate is how many guesses a machine is allowed to make. The budget
/// is [#MAX_FAILURES] failures in [#WINDOW]; the attempt that goes over it is refused for [#BLOCK],
/// and a sign-in that succeeds in between clears the record, because the password being right is the
/// one thing this is asking about.
///
/// **Nothing is said while the budget is intact.** An attacker learns nothing from a policy it cannot
/// see, and somebody who has simply mistyped is not told about a counter that is still theirs to
/// spend. What is said is the refusal — and only when it happens.
///
/// The key is the address the request came from. Behind a reverse proxy that is the proxy's address,
/// so the budget is shared by everyone that proxy serves: that is the deliberate trade, because the
/// header a proxy would be recognised by (`X-Forwarded-For`) is one a client can write itself, and
/// trusting it would let a single attacker both evade this and spend everybody else's budget.
///
/// A refused address is refused *before* the password is checked. Checking it is the expensive half —
/// a PBKDF2 derivation at the iteration count this panel uses — and spending that is exactly what an
/// attacker is trying to do.
