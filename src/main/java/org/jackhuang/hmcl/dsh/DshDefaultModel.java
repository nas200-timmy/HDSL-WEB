/// Sets the model the harness starts with, by editing two keys of its settings file.
///
/// A route in the profile's patch layer says what the harness is offered; it does not make the
/// harness *use* it. Which supplier and model to start on is recorded in one place, the
/// `agent-default-model` section, and a patch cannot put it there: the harness keeps that answer in
/// its own settings, which are applied over every layer of the composition. It has to be set where
/// the person's own answer lives.
///
/// **Only a line is ever rewritten.** The harness reads this file, and while it runs it also writes
/// it — under a cross-process lock, with a leaf-level diff that keeps comments and formatting. So
/// the one thing this must never do is take a copy of the file and put it back later: a restore
/// would silently discard every change the person made through the interface during the run, and
/// could race the harness's own atomic write. What is done here is the smallest edit that has an
/// effect — the two scalar values under the section's own indentation — leaving every other byte,
/// including comments about them, exactly where it was.
///
/// Nothing else is touched, and the edit is skipped whenever it would have to guess. A route with
/// no model named is left alone: the harness refuses to start on a default it cannot resolve, so an
/// invented model name would turn a helpful default into a launch that fails.
