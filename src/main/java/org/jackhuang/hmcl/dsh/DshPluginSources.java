/// Installs a plugin from the source a person names: a repository, or a directory on this machine.
///
/// A plugin published to a registry is installed by name and version, which is what the plugin
/// market does. One that lives only in a repository — a fork, a branch somebody is working on, a
/// package nobody ever published — is installed from the repository and a revision instead, and one
/// somebody is still writing is installed from the directory it is in. pnpm takes all of those as a
/// single specification, so the work here is turning what a person types into that specification,
/// and handing it to the installer that already exists ([DshPluginInstaller#installSpecs]).
///
/// **Repositories.** Four addresses are understood, and they are the ones pnpm understands:
///
/// - a GitHub link or shorthand — `owner/name`, `github:owner/name`, `https://github.com/owner/name`
///   — becomes `github:owner/name`, which is what the ecosystem writes into a profile;
/// - another host's link becomes `git+<address>`, and the prefix is not decoration: to npm a bare
///   `https://` address is a **tarball**, not a repository;
/// - the `gitlab:` / `bitbucket:` / `gist:` shorthands and the scp-like `git@host:owner/name` are
///   passed through, because they already say which host to fetch from;
/// - a tarball over HTTP is passed through as it stands, which is what it is.
///
/// The revision is optional and may be a branch, a tag or a commit — pnpm resolves all three — and
/// it may be written where a browser writes it, as `.../tree/<branch>` in the address or
/// `#<revision>` after it. What the revision field says wins over what the address says, on the
/// grounds that somebody who fills the field in has just said which revision they mean.
///
/// **Directories.** `file:<path>`, `link:<path>` and a bare absolute path are the three ways of
/// writing the same thing, and pnpm reads all three as a local dependency. The path must be
/// absolute, which is the same rule the plugin manager itself applies and for the same reason: the
/// working directory means nothing to somebody typing into a dialog, and a relative path resolved
/// against the profile would point inside it. `link:` is the one to use while working on a plugin —
/// it is a live link, so an edit lands on the next boot — and `file:` installs a snapshot of the
/// directory as it is now. What a directory is *not* is a revision: a local path is installed as it
/// stands, so a branch, tag or commit alongside it is refused rather than ignored.
