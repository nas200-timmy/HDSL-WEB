/// The community's terminal interfaces for DeepSeek Harness, as a curated list.
///
/// [DshSurface] has no TUI member, and there is no `dsh-tui` subcommand either: a
/// terminal interface comes from a plugin, installed into a profile and started by
/// booting that profile (`dsh --profile <name>`; upstream also accepts the profile
/// name as a bare word, `dsh <name>`). What the list pins, therefore, is not only
/// *which* package — it is **which profile**, because that is the part that decides
/// whether the instance starts at all:
///
/// **A terminal plugin never goes into the web profile.** Both are *app* plugins: each
/// parses the whole argv with its own grammar, and upstream does not arbitrate between
/// two of them. Installed together they collide on the first flag the other one owns —
/// the community's own report is `error: unknown option '--no-open'` — so the instance
/// does not merely lose its terminal, it stops starting. That is why every entry names
/// the profile its own documentation installs into, why [refuseAppProfile] refuses the
/// profiles the harness ships apps for, and why a terminal is always started on the
/// plugin's own profile rather than the instance's.
///
/// Three things about an entry are decisions rather than descriptions:
///
/// - the **pinned version**. The panel installs `name@version` and not `name`, so a
///   profile keeps working when the author publishes something new;
/// - the **profile**: what the plugin's own README says to use (`tui`, `pi-tui`,
///   `dsh-tui`), never the instance's `web`;
/// - the **bin name**, when the package ships one. Everything else is a pure bundle and
///   is started by booting its profile, which is what its own documentation shows.
///
/// The list is a constant rather than a fetch: it is short, it changes when an author
/// publishes, and a page that had to reach the network to say what a terminal plugin is
/// would be unable to explain itself offline.
