/// The pnpm configuration file, and the one line of it the settings page is responsible for.
///
/// **pnpm does not read its registry from the environment.** Measured on this image
/// (pnpm 11.28.2): `NPM_CONFIG_REGISTRY=https://a.example.invalid/ pnpm config get registry` answers
/// with the configured registry, and `npm_config_store_dir` is ignored the same way. What pnpm
/// reads is this file — `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/pnpm/config.yaml`, which the container's entrypoint
/// writes once at startup from `NPM_CONFIG_REGISTRY`. npm, by contrast, does read the environment.
///
/// That asymmetry is why a setting changed in the panel has to be written here to be worth
/// anything: every pnpm invocation the launcher makes goes through this file — including the
/// `pnpm` that `dsh plugin` runs for itself, which the launcher never sees the command line of.
/// Passing `--registry=` at the call sites the launcher owns (which it also does, so the choice is
/// visible in the logs) cannot reach that one.
///
/// The file is rewritten rather than parsed: every line that is not this setting is kept exactly
/// as it was, so a `storeDir` an operator set by hand survives, and the value written is quoted by
/// [YamlScalar] rather than interpolated — the difference between a URL and a second setting.
///
/// ## Windows keeps the same fact in two other files
///
/// Measured on Windows 10 with pnpm 11.28.6, by running `pnpm config set` and watching which file
/// changed:
///
/// | what | where pnpm reads it |
/// | --- | --- |
/// | the registry | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\pnpm\config\auth.ini`, as `registry=<address>` |
/// | everything else (`storeDir`) | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\pnpm\config\config.yaml` |
///
/// Neither `%LOCALAPPDATA%\pnpm\config\rc` nor `$HOME/.config/pnpm/config.yaml` is read for the
/// registry there — a value written to either is silently ignored, which is how a Chinese mirror
/// configured in the panel still reached npmjs.org. The registry lives in an `auth.ini` because an
/// address may carry credentials, and that is why the two halves are separate files rather than
/// two keys in one.
