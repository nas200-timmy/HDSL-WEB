/// Decides whether a plugin's install scripts may run.
///
/// A package can carry a script that runs when it is installed, and a package manager
/// will not run one unless it is told to: that is the whole point of the setting, since
/// the script runs with the user's own rights and nobody has read it. When pnpm meets a
/// package it will not build, it writes the package into the profile's
/// `pnpm-workspace.yaml` with a placeholder instead of an answer:
///
/// ```yaml
/// allowBuilds:
///   node-pty: set this to true or false
/// ```
///
/// and refuses the installation until somebody answers. Answering is a decision about
/// running code, so this launcher does not answer on its own: it reads what is waiting
/// so the interface can say so, and writes an answer when a person gives one. That is
/// what makes it a setting rather than a behaviour — one that can be on for an instance
/// whose plugins are known and off for one whose plugins are not.
