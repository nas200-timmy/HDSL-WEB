/// Where an unpacked Node.js distribution keeps the files it is driven through.
///
/// The two shapes are not variations on one theme, they are two layouts that share
/// nothing but the version of Node inside them:
///
/// | | Linux / macOS | Windows |
/// |---|---|---|
/// | `node` | `bin/node` | `node.exe` |
/// | `npm` | `bin/npm` | `npm.cmd` |
/// | `npx` | `bin/npx` | `npx.cmd` |
/// | `pnpm`, once installed | `bin/pnpm` | `pnpm.cmd` |
/// | what goes on `PATH` | `bin/` | the root |
///
/// On Linux `npm` and `npx` are symlinks into `lib/node_modules`; on Windows they are
/// batch shims that find `node.exe` *beside themselves* — which is why the directory to
/// put on `PATH` is the root there and `bin/` elsewhere, and why asking for
/// `bin/npm` on Windows does not fail loudly but simply never finds anything.
