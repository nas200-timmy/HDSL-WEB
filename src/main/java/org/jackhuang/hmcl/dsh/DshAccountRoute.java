/// The supplier an account gives the harness, kept in the profile's **own** patch layer.
///
/// The harness asks the person to configure a model supplier before it will answer anything. The
/// launcher can spare them that: it holds a key already — that is what an account is — so it hands
/// the harness a route for it.
///
/// The route goes into the same file the harness's own configuration editor writes,
/// `$DSH_HOME/profiles/<profile>/cordis.patch.yml`, under the supplier entry's
/// `config.providers.<route>`. It used to travel as a `--patch` overlay instead, and that is what had
/// to change, because an overlay cannot be composed with the editor:
///
/// - `readProfilePatches` applies the bundle layers, then the profile's own layer, then the home
///   layer, then the `--patch` overlays — the overlays last;
/// - `applyEntryPatches` sets each key of a patch row onto the entry (`target[key] = value`), so a
///   row's `config` **replaces** the entry's config rather than merging with it: an overlay naming
///   `llm-pi-ai` owned every supplier the run had, not just the account's;
/// - the editor refuses a save whose recomposed value is not what the person asked for, with
///   `Configuration for "llm-pi-ai" is overridden by a home patch or command-line overlay`.
///
/// So while an instance was launched with an account, adding a supplier in the harness was impossible
/// and the suppliers the person had saved were invisible — the same defect seen from two sides.
/// Written into the profile's own layer there is nothing above it: the document the editor writes is
/// the document that is composed, and its guard passes by construction.
///
/// The route lives in that file **for as long as the launch does**, and no longer. It has to be there
/// while the harness runs — that is what the models page draws and edits — and it has to go when the
/// launch ends, because its key travels in a variable only that launch set: a route left behind is a
/// supplier the harness offers with nothing behind it, and the next launch, with an account or with
/// none, would inherit it. So a launch writes its own route (refreshed from the vendor every time)
/// and the end of that launch takes it back, byte for byte. Two things keep that safe:
///
/// - the key travels in a variable named after the route ([#environmentVariable]), so a route from a
///   home whose launcher was killed names a variable nothing sets. It fails loudly, and it cannot
///   pick up the key of whichever account is launched next;
/// - every launch first takes back what it can recognise as its own — the ledger's routes — except
///   the one it is about to write.
///
/// The key itself is still never written anywhere: the route names an environment variable, and the
/// value travels in the child's environment, which leaves no trace and is gone with the process.
