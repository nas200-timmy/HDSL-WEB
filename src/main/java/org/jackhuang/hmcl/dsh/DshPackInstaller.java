/// Fetches a pack from the market and puts it where it belongs.
///
/// Three steps, and the specification is explicit that none of them may be skipped:
///
/// 1. **Download to a temporary file**, never straight into a profile. A half-written pack in a
///    profile is a broken installation; a half-written pack in the cache is a file to delete.
/// 2. **Check the length** against the index's `size`. This is the cheap check, and it catches the
///    common failure — a truncated transfer — before the expensive one.
/// 3. **Check the digest** against the index's `sha256`, byte for byte. A pack that fails either
///    check is **discarded**, not kept and reported: what the index described is the only thing worth
///    installing, and a file that is not it has no use.
///
/// The three values are the index's *pointers*, and they are the whole reason the market step and the
/// install step can be spoken of separately: the market's job ends by handing over a verified file.
///
/// ## Untrusted archives
///
/// A pack is somebody else's archive. Everything here treats its member names as hostile until shown
/// otherwise: an entry whose path climbs out of the destination is refused, an entry naming a file the
/// launcher must never accept is refused, and an entry that is a symbolic link is dropped rather than
/// followed. The export side already filters all of this, but a pack from the market was not
/// necessarily made by this launcher — and a previous bug in this very project (`sessions/../planted/x`
/// in a session pack) is why the rule is "never trust a member name".
